## What is this repo about?
It can be time consuming to have to repeatedly set up the same things over again, when working across different projects, which is why i have created this repo,
such that i have all my set up in one place, thus saving me time.

## Dependencies
Quick tip: Dependencies can be installed from the package.json file by running npm install.
```properties
